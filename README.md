A tiny Bevy plugin that counts the number of render pipelines that are ready and makes that data available as a resource in the main world.

This is useful for creating a nice loading experience for your Bevy app, especially on the web where execution is single-threaded and pipeline building is disruptive.

## Usage

See [`examples/states.rs`](examples/states.rs).
